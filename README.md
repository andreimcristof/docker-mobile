### What is this
a mobile app to control your (local) docker containers with.

### How to use this
 The app uses an API which is connected to the Docker Engine on your machine. That's the API. It's here:
 https://github.com/andreimcristof/docker-mobile-api

 Make sure your docker engine is runnning locally. Then start that API. Then you can use this app in the iOS / Android simulator, to make calls to the API and interact with your docker containers.
