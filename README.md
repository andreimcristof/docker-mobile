### What is this
a mobile app to control your (local) docker containers with.

### How to use this
 The app uses an API which connects to the Docker Engine on your machine. That one is that way:

 Make sure your docker engine is runnning locally. Then start that API. Then you can use this app in the iOS / Android simulator, to make calls to the API and interact with your docker containers. In the near future I will put the API in the cloud and the overhead will not be required in order to demonstrate the point of this mobile app. But for now use the ios simulator to make requests locally.
